Hello world! This is me trying my first github repository. Please don't laugh

This is my first attempt at ASCII artwork. What do you think it is?

                            ..................... A chilli pepper of course!
I adore spices, especially when they involve a tingling, numbing sensation on the tongue.
I love spicy food so much that on my visit to Sichuan province in China, I bought a kilo of dried numbing Sichuan peppercorns and chillies.

I'm serious. 

I'm a freak for urban planning & design and public transit, but alas, I have a degree in something that's only tangentially related (materials engineering anyone? Materials are literally the base of anything you touch ever...it made sense at the time, ok)

I've traveled the world. And when I travel, I really try to experience things that locals would, because it's those intangible experiences that will forever shape the way I see the world (this was before Airbnb was a thing, I swear!).

Please get in touch! I'm hopeful to help others move around this world. One tuk tuk at a time.
